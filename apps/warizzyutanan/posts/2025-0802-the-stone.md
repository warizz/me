## My Thoughts
The production looked solid, but the story felt underwhelming. I expected clever con games, but it focused mainly on stealing a sacred amulet and chasing it down. The father-son angle and the tycoon’s child subplot added some drama, but nothing surprising.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- Ake receives an amulet from his father, Boonlong, to sell for money to pay for Boonlong’s medical treatment.
- The amulet is identified as a famous Somdej worth hundreds of millions, with help from trader Muay.
- Muay secretly swaps the real amulet with a fake.
- Viktor appears, revealed to be the son of a tycoon Boonlong killed decades earlier.
- The amulet originally belonged to Viktor’s father, who was murdered during the incident.
- A violent series of events unfolds as everyone tries to reclaim the amulet.
- In the end, everyone except Ake is killed.
- It’s revealed Boonlong never sold the amulet because he wanted to protect it until Viktor was old enough to keep it safe from being stolen.
