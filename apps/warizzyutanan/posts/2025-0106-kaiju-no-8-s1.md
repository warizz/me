## 3 Jan

Started. The protagonist is a typical good-hearted loser.

## 4 Jan

Exciting scenes with a genius female character during the exam and a boss fight where the protagonist steps in to help. Very entertaining.

## 6 Jan

The protagonist finally reveals his true identity. Overall, it has a vibe similar to many popular anime, like _Evangelion_ and _Attack on Titan_. The vice-captain even resembles Levi. Finished Season 1—it's cliché but still a lot of fun.
