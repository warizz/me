## My thoughts
What makes *Solo Leveling* so fun is the feeling of revenge—watching a weak E-rank hunter rise and shut down everyone who ever looked down on him. It’s that classic underdog story, but with an RPG twist. Every episode gives you that boost of satisfaction seeing the main character get stronger, unlock new powers, and overcome impossible challenges.   

I especially enjoyed how his strength grows step by step. Whether he’s clearing secret dungeons, soloing boss fights, or quietly saving teammates, it feels like watching your own game character evolve. By the time he easily defeats a near-S-rank boss, you really feel how far he’s come. He’s definitely overpowered now, but that’s what makes it so fun.

## Summary (Full spoilers)
- Jin-Woo starts as an E-rank hunter, considered the weakest in Korea.
- During a dungeon raid, he survives a deadly trial and gains a unique "System".
- The System lets him level up like in a video game, increasing his stats and skills.
- He trains in secret, clearing solo dungeons and becoming stronger.
- Gains the ability to summon shadows of fallen enemies to fight for him.
- Re-evaluates his rank and is promoted to S-rank, but turns down high positions.
- Joins A-rank raids and secretly saves his team without revealing his true strength.
- Attracts the attention of other high-ranking hunters.
- Joins the Jeju Island Raid, where Korean and Japanese S-rank hunters fight powerful ant monsters.
- Jin-Woo arrives mid-battle, defeats the Ant King solo, and even turns him into a shadow.
