Overall, the book was just okay. I enjoyed the parts about cat behavior, though they were brief in each chapter. The sections on how we can learn from cats didn't provide much new information for me. If you're new to self-help or productivity, you might find it more useful.

I also prefer the cover of the Thai translated version.
