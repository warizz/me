## My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- Visuals are stunning, though the protagonist’s girlfriend looks oddly unattractive.
- Game isn’t perfectly polished but overall well done.
- Combat system is very satisfying; parrying is tricky at first.
- Grinding works effectively, making the game easier—rare in modern RPGs.
- Story is sad, with strong cosmic horror elements.
- François, Esquie, and the gestrals provide fun comic relief.
- Feels like a love letter to old-school JRPGs:
  - Lots of endgame exploration.
  - Freedom to become overpowered.
- Atmosphere, character design, enemy design, and scenery are excellent, similar to Souls games.
- Weak point: the “everything is just a painting” twist reduces the world’s emotional weight.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- Each year the **Paintress** erases people of a chosen age (the Gommage).
- Gustave joins Expedition 33 after losing his lover Sophie. Companions: Maelle, Lune, Sciel, Verso, Monoco.
- They fight Renoir (Verso’s father) and the Paintress, revealed as **Aline**, Verso’s mother.
- Killing her ends the countdown; truth revealed: the world is a **painted Canvas** born of family tragedy.
- Maelle is really **Alicia Dessendre**, Aline’s daughter; Verso is her painted brother.
- Final choice:
  - **Alicia ending**: stay in the Canvas.
  - **Verso ending**: destroy the Canvas.
