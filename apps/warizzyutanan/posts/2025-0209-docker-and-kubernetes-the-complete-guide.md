## My Thoughts

I decided to enroll in this course because I've heard about Kubernetes (K8s) for a long time. Since I've worked with DevOps for a while, I wanted to understand what it actually does. Initially, I found Docker Compose very useful, but when I got to K8s, I just listened passively since I didn't think Iâ€™d need it anytime soon. However, as I kept going, I came across Helm and Skaffold, which turned out to be quite interesting!

## Summary

**Container**: A lightweight software package that runs consistently across environments. This course explains what it is and how it works.

**Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker apps. I learned and understood the usage of volumes here.

**Kubernetes (K8s)**: An orchestration system for managing containers in production. I learned that it is used for deployment.

**Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying deployment.

**Skaffold**: A tool for automating local Kubernetes development.
