WARNING! Contain full spoilers

The book starts with a thriller vibe but feels slow at first because of long descriptions. It gets more exciting with twists and cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. Skipping the detailed parts and focusing on the dialogue makes it easier to follow.

The story is about Ruth and Amanda. Naomi, who is actually Ruth, has a condition that makes her see some people as her past abuser, so she feels like she has to kill them. She and Amanda make a deal to kill for each other.

Later, it’s revealed that Billy, who helps Amanda, is Ruth’s old abuser and a serial killer too. In the end, Billy kills Crone (Amanda’s abuser) for her but also kills Ruth. The story ends with Amanda escaping punishment.
