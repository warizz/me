WARNING! Contain spoilers

## 24 Nov

Bought the book because itâ€™s a classic sci-fi and was free. First impression: hard to read.

## 26 Nov

Still difficult to read after two chapters. It's focused on industrialized child-rearing with little plot progression.

## 28 Nov

The story starts to develop, introducing a female character named Lenina.

## 5 Dec

The protagonist meets John and Linda in a "reservation," a world outside their society. The stigma against childbirth in this world is unusual.

## 8 Dec

John (the Savage) becomes famous and gets involved with Lenina.

## 11 Dec

Finally finished. Rated it 2/5 stars on Amazon because I found it boring. The dialogue between the Savage and the Controller near the end was interesting, though. The ending is striking: John, unable to fit into society, isolates himself, but still gets harassed and ultimately takes his own life.
