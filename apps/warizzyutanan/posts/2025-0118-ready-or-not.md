A mix of comedy and horror, with a predictable plot but enough intrigue to keep you curious about the ending—and it delivers a satisfying conclusion. The chase scenes in the middle drag on too long and could’ve been cut down to about ten minutes.  

The heroine stands out with her cool, striking looks. One memorable scene shows her in a wedding dress, sneakers, and carrying a rifle—an effortlessly badass moment.
