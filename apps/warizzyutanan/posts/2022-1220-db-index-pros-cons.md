I just got a question from an interview about the pros and cons of database indexes. I instantly realized that I didn't answer it well even though it is very crucial knowledge (even for a front-end engineer like me).

## Pros
- Better performance in searching or related tasks.

## Cons
- Increased disk space.
- Slower data modification, and updating records.
