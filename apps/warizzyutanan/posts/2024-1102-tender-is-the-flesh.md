(Curious) 22 Oct: Bought the book. A virus made animals inedible. The explanation of human breeding is unsettling.

(Confused) Writing in third person made it hard to follow; unclear who "he" refers to.

Descriptive writing creates vivid images. Ency, a worker, broke down after empathizing with "meat." Tejo’s wife broke after failing to have children.

(Dislike) Skipped dream scenes; didn’t enjoy them. Sex scenes felt cliché and unnecessary.

(Disturbed) 28 Oct: Tejo impregnates a head woman. At this point, it felt really messed up.

(Shocked) 2 Nov: Finished the book. The ending was twisted—Tejo kills Jasmine after she gives birth.

(Meh) Overall, 3/5. The story was mediocre.
