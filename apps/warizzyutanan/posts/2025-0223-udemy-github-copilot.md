## My Thoughts & Learnings
- @workspace: Never knew about this before—seems useful.
- Highlighted then ask: Adding more context can improve Copilot’s suggestions.
- Inline chat: 
	- Using comments can help guide Copilot better.
	- Comment-driven prompts: Should describe the expected outcome rather than the steps to achieve it.
- Scanning vulnerabilities: Useful feature for detecting issues in the codebase.
- @vscode: Can be used to ask Copilot about VS Code-related queries.
- Copilot CLI / GH CLI: Supports Copilot but doesn’t seem particularly exciting yet.
- @terminal: Can use Copilot to generate code snippets.
- Shortcuts: Using hashtags in chat speeds up interactions.
- @workspace /new: Can create new projects, but it's outdated and not recommended.
