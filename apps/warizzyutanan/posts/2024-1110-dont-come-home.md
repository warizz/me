WARNING! Contain spoilers

The horror and creepiness are decent, though the small details could be improved. A funny moment happened when Daeng, my cat, jumped just before a jump scare startled both of us.

The story reveals a time loop but has a major plot hole—Wari, the female lead, is somehow her own child, which seems impossible. The film doesn’t explain this, leaving it confusing. A Season 2 might clarify things, but for now, it doesn’t make much sense.
