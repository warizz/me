Started strong with great quality and an amazing kick scene that inspired me to draw. The fun continues through the episodes, with weird yet creative designs connecting ghosts and aliens. The action scenes are well-made and exciting, with stunning background art.  

Highlights include the hero and heroine's playful arguments, the introduction of a mischievous pink-haired girl, and a granny who speed-possesses a catâ€”adorably fun. Episode 7 stands out with a touching mother-daughter story that gained attention online for its sadness.  

By the final episode, the humor, romance, and animation quality remain excellent. A bit sad it ended, but I hope the next season maintains this level of quality.
