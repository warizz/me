I bought the game on Dec 20, and the gameplay turned out to be incredibly fun and addictive. The quality-of-life features and UI are excellent, making everything smooth and satisfying. I even found myself sneaking in playtime during work—definitely a sign of how much I enjoyed it.

## Progress and Grinding
I finished the story on Jan 5 and started using Assist Mode on Jan 7. Even with auto-play, the real fun was in the grinding. By Jan 9, I had my first level 150 weapon, and by Jan 11, I entered the true farming phase. Thankfully, AFK farming helped a lot.

## Challenging Quests
Some of the hardest quests stood out. The first, **"The Final Report,"** required defeating Bahamut Versa, which had two intense DPS checks that made the battle thrilling. Another tough challenge was **"The Wolf and the Veil,"** where I had to face both Gallanza and Maglielle simultaneously. Surviving while relying on my team to deal damage was a unique test of strategy and patience.

## Farming and Collectibles
The grind was engaging, from collecting sigils to farming Terminus weapons. On Jan 17, I defeated Proto Bahamut for the first time—not as hard as expected. After multiple runs, I finally got my first Terminus weapon. Collecting them all took a long time, with Namarya’s obtained on Jan 19 and Yoharda’s fully upgraded by Jan 29.
By Jan 31, I had all Terminus weapons for my available companions and moved on to farming team member cards. On Feb 1, I completed the roster for the trophy, then finished all Fate Episodes on Feb 2. Finally, on Feb 6, I acquired all Terminus weapons and started Ultimate difficulty. The Platinum trophy came on Feb 8—Ultimate difficulty wasn’t too hard, but collecting all the Terminus weapons was the real grind.

## Character Preferences
Namarya was my first main, but later I switched to Yodarha because it looked cooler and was more fun to use. Honestly, every character in the game is well-designed and appealing. They all look amazing, and I wish I had more time—or motivation—to try them all.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this game was a blast. The graphics, gameplay, and systems were all fantastic. The only downside was the story, but at least skipping cutscenes was easy. I'd rate it **4.5/5**, deducting 0.5 for the weak story—but it’s still worth playing. It took me **155 hours** to earn the Platinum trophy, making it a truly rewarding experience.
