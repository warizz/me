WARNING! Contain full spoilers

## My Thoughts
Naomi Watts is still as stunning as ever, while Viggo Mortensen perfectly embodies the quiet, brooding gangster type. The film has a solid plot, and the brutal throat-slitting scene at the beginning is both shocking and effective in setting the tone. The story remains engaging throughout, but certain details feel off—like the operating room scene or some character decisions that don’t quite make sense. Despite these flaws, _Eastern Promises_ delivers an intense and gripping crime thriller.

## Plot Summary
Set in London, the film follows Anna, a midwife who comes across a deceased teenage girl’s diary. As she seeks its translation, she becomes entangled with the Russian mafia, led by the ruthless Semyon. His enforcer, Nikolai, remains enigmatic, rising within the organization while secretly working undercover. The diary reveals dark secrets, leading to a power struggle within the mafia. In the end, Semyon is arrested, Kirill is left broken, and Nikolai takes control, suggesting he continues his undercover mission while securing his place at the top.
