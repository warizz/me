## My Thoughts
For me, the movie was just okay. But Nami seemed touched by the story of an old man living alone in loneliness. I got annoyed at some of the main character’s decisions—they didn’t always make sense to me. That said, Ben Kingsley gave a great performance. He really captured that awkward, confused energy of an elderly person. Or maybe he’s just like that now, I’m not sure. The Alzheimer's theme always hits me emotionally too.

## Summary (Full Spoilers)
- Milton, a lonely old man, finds a crashed UFO in his backyard and hides the alien inside, naming it Jules.  
- His neighbors, Sandy and Joyce, discover Jules but choose to help.  
- The three form a bond with the alien, finding comfort and meaning.  
- Jules doesn’t speak but brings peace to their lives.  
- As government agents close in, Jules repairs his ship and leaves.  
- Milton, showing signs of Alzheimer’s, is left changed but more connected than before.
