## My Thoughts
The story had nothing special, but it was still entertaining. I enjoyed watching the strange behaviors, the beautiful scenery, and some intense moments. The violent scenes were present, but not too extreme.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- King Aurvandill returns home to his wife Gudrún and son Amleth. Soon after, Aurvandill is murdered by his brother Fjölnir, who takes the throne and Gudrún. Amleth escapes, vowing: *avenge father, save mother, kill Fjölnir*.
- Years later, Amleth becomes a brutal Viking warrior. A prophecy reminds him of his vow. He learns Fjölnir lost his kingdom and now lives in Iceland. Amleth disguises himself as a slave to infiltrate Fjölnir’s farm.
- On the way, he meets Olga, a Slavic sorceress, who becomes his ally and lover. At the farm, Amleth discovers Gudrún married Fjölnir and had a son, Gunnar.
- Amleth secretly kills Fjölnir’s men and spreads fear. When he reveals himself to Gudrún, she shocks him: she hated Aurvandill and wanted him dead. She claims Amleth was born from rape and tries to seduce him.
- Furious, Amleth kills Fjölnir’s older son Thórir and cuts out his heart. Captured and tortured, Amleth escapes with Olga’s help. She reveals she is pregnant with twins.
- Amleth foresees their future greatness but returns to finish his revenge. He kills Gudrún and Gunnar during the chaos.
- Amleth and Fjölnir face each other in a naked duel at an erupting volcano. Both die after a brutal fight. As he dies, Amleth envisions Olga safe with their twins, then a Valkyrie takes him to Valhalla.
