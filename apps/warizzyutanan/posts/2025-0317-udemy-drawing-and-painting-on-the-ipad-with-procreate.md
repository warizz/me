## Canvas & Layers
- Larger canvas sizes reduce the number of available layers to maintain performance.
- Alpha Lock – Locks transparency, allowing painting only on existing pixels.
- Layer Blend Modes – Adjust how layers interact with each other for different effects.
- Layer Grouping – Helps organize layers for a more efficient workflow.
- Reference Layer – Allows tools like the Paint Drop to use borders from another layer.
- Masking – Works like masking tape, with two types:
  - Normal Masking – Applied directly to a layer.
  - Layer Masking – Uses the layer below as a mask.
## Drawing Tools & Techniques
- Holding a drawn line refines it automatically.
- Holding another finger on the screen while drawing adjusts the angle.
- For precise and steady lines, use Studio Pen, then adjust for smooth strokes.
## Color & Painting Features
- Color Drop Tool Threshold – Controls how color fills within an area.
- Procreate supports 3D painting on objects.
## Grid & Assisted Drawing
- Isometric Drawing – Uses grids for accurate perspective work.
