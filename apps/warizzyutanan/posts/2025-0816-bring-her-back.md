## My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- Watched Bring Her Back on Apple TV without knowing anything beforehand, just like with Weapons. 
- The movie was mainly about black magic, with a heavy and tense atmosphere. At first, it looked like a gory horror, but it turned out to be more about the bond between a caring brother and sister. 
- Piper was cute, which made me wonder if she was really blind. 
- The tension built around Andy being falsely accused made me feel sorry for him, especially when he died and it was revealed he had also been abused by his father. 
- The ending felt a bit weak, since the villain chose not to kill Piper for whatever reason, which undercut the suspense. 
- Still, overall it was enjoyable, though not as gory as expected.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- Andy and his half-sister Piper lose their father and are placed in the care of Laura, a grieving foster mother.
- Laura secretly practices black magic, hoping to resurrect her drowned daughter Cathy.
She uses foster child Oliver, who is possessed, as part of the ritual.
- Andy discovers the truth but is falsely accused and eventually killed by Laura.
- Piper becomes the intended vessel for Cathy’s return, but Laura hesitates when Piper screams out like her daughter.
- Piper escapes and is rescued, while Oliver collapses as the demon leaves him.
- The police arrive, and Laura ends up cradling her daughter’s mutilated corpse in the pool as the film ends.
