## My Thoughts
The show is visually stunning, with great cinematography and atmosphere. The acting is strong, especially Ha-bin, who is incredibly charming. However, the slow pace makes it feel longer than necessary—five episodes would have been ideal. Watching at 1.5x speed might improve the experience. Despite some confusion in the plot, the series remains engaging and worth watching.

## Plot
In the final episode, the real murderer is revealed to be Kim Seung-hui, a woman who exploited runaway teenagers. Ha-bin's mother, Ji-soo, had wrongly believed Ha-bin killed her friend, Soo-hyun, leading to her guilt and eventual suicide. This misunderstanding caused a deep rift between Ha-bin and her father, Tae-su. When Ha-bin tries to take revenge on Seung-hui, Tae-su stops her and finally apologizes for doubting her. Realizing his failures, he resigns from his job. The series ends with Tae-su and Ha-bin reconciling over a meal, symbolizing a fresh start.
