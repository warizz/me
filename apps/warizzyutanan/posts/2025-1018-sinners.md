## My thoughts
I rented it on Apple TV after hearing good things on *Half in the Bag*. At first, I thought it was just a drama about racial oppression, so I didn’t watch it. But once I discovered it was a vampire film, I made time immediately. What I liked: the characters have real depth, there’s humor, Hailee Steinfeld is charming, and the vampire characters have interesting backstories. The build-up is long but never boring because the story keeps me engaged. The scene where Sammie plays music and summons the vampires is very cool. The vampire showdown is exciting and easy to root for. The ending is stylish and satisfying.

## Summary (Full Spoilers)
* The story takes place in 1932 Mississippi Delta.
* Twin brothers Elijah “Smoke” Moore and Elias “Stack” Moore (both played by Michael B. Jordan) return home after working for the Chicago mob and bring stolen money to start fresh.
* They buy a sawmill and plan to open a juke-joint for their local Black community.
* Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his father—a pastor—warning him about the sinful nature of blues music.
* Their new venture unknowingly draws supernatural evil: vampires who begin to prey on the town.
* On opening night, Sammie’s performance becomes both art and weapon as his music lures the vampires.
* The brothers and their allies fight back against the vampire leader and his followers.
* Smoke is fatally wounded but finds peace through his daughter’s spirit. Stack becomes immortal, cursed as a vampire. Sammie survives and later becomes a successful blues musician.
* In the epilogue, decades later, an ageless Stack visits Sammie’s blues club. Sammie reflects that despite the horror, the night they opened the juke-joint was the greatest day of his life.
