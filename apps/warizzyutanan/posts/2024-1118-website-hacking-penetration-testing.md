## Tools and Techniques:
- **Website Information:**
  - Use [who.is](https://who.is/) and [Robtex](https://robtex.com/) to gather website details.
  - Discovering subdomains can expose vulnerabilities in less-secured or experimental subdomains, potentially allowing access to other subdomains on the same server.

- **SQL Map**
  - Tool for automating SQL injection testing.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
  - Three types of XSS.
  - Client-side input validation is weak since attackers can edit the client-side HTML.

- **Backdoors**:
  - Two types:
    - **Direct:** Hacker initiates contact with the victim.
    - **Reverse:** Victim initiates contact with the hacker.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
  - Exploits API calls from another site (e.g., changing passwords).

- **Brute Force Attacks**:
  - Method of systematically trying all possible passwords or keys.
