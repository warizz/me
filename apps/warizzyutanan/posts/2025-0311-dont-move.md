## My Thoughts  
Don't Move delivers solid tension and gripping moments, but it follows a familiar thriller formula, making it predictable at times. Some scenes had me on edge, while others felt repetitive and dragged a bit. Still, Kelsey Asbille's face is stunning.

## Summary (Full Spoilers)  
Iris, mourning her son’s death, visits his memorial, contemplating suicide. A stranger, Richard, approaches, seemingly offering comfort, but suddenly attacks her. He injects her with a paralytic agent that will slowly shut down her body. She escapes into the forest, but the drug starts taking effect.  

She finds refuge with an old man, Bill, who takes her to his cabin. Richard arrives, pretending to be her husband, but Bill grows suspicious and calls the authorities. A struggle ensues—Bill is killed, and Richard burns the cabin down. He then takes Iris to a lake, planning to drown her. As her motor skills return, she stabs him and shoots him with a stolen gun. The sinking boat forces her to swim ashore. She finds Richard barely alive, thanks him for reigniting her will to live, and leaves him to die.  

In the end, Iris chooses life, overcoming her grief and reclaiming control over her future.
