## My Thoughts
I love it! The new focus system really spices up the gameplay — everything feels faster and flashier. The quality of life in this game also improved a lot, which makes the overall experience much more enjoyable.

I switched from my usual hammer main to trying the lance. It’s more fun than I expected — just blocking and poking without needing to move much. Feels solid.

I bought a 3-month PS Plus Essential just to unlock the trophy that requires 100 online hunts. Playing online is way easier than solo — most players are really skilled, so hunts go much smoother.

On April 15, I got the platinum trophy. Overall, it didn’t take too long (around 90 hours), and hunting trophies wasn’t too painful. The crown-related trophies rely heavily on luck, but this game lets you use a scope to measure monster size, which helps a lot. I can’t imagine how much time it would take in older games that didn’t have this.

Fishing and item rarity 6 trophies weren’t that fun, but at least they didn’t take forever.

All in all, I loved it. Easily one of the most enjoyable games I’ve played — potential Game of the Year.
