## My Thoughts
- The series felt repetitive; it's good that it concluded.
- Despite the repetition, there were unexpected twists that kept it engaging.
- Overall, still enjoyable to watch.
- The new female lead wasn't particularly attractive to me.
- This season frequently addressed themes like gaslighting and women's self-worth.
