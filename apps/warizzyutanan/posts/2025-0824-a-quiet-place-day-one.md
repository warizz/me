## My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- Sam’s constant irritability makes sense—she’s a cancer patient in pain, vulnerable and raw.
- The movie doesn’t build much suspense—watchable, but not thrilling.
- The evolving bond between Sam and Eric is genuine and refreshing, especially with no romantic angle.
- Some creature-hearing rules felt inconsistent, making me question the logic.
- The final scene—Sam appearing to help the protagonist—was unexpected and puzzling. How did she survive?
- The cat, Frodo, was the standout—it brought warmth and levity to an otherwise heavy story.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- Sam, a terminally ill hospice patient, ventures into NYC with her cat, Frodo.
- Alien creatures invade—sound-sensitive monsters disrupt the city. Sam wakes amid survivors in a puppet theater.
- She flees toward Harlem; bridges are bombed to quarantine the invasion.
- Her nurse, Reuben, is killed when a noisy shirt rips and attracts a creature.
- Sam meets Eric, a British law student. They endure flooded subways and creature attacks.
- In a church refuge, Eric fetches her medication and rescues Frodo; they witness creatures feeding on organic pods.
- Sam’s final wish is a pizza in Harlem, reminiscent of childhood tradition. Eric delivers pizza and a magic trick to brighten her spirits.
- Sam creates a noisy distraction with car alarms to lure creatures away so Eric and Frodo can board a rescue boat.
- Eric escapes with Frodo and finds Sam’s heartfelt note asking him to care for the cat.
- Alone in silent NYC, Sam plays Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” loudly, accepting her fate. A creature appears behind her—the screen cuts to black.
