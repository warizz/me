### My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- The conflicts are thought-provoking. If I were in those situations, I’d feel conflicted too. The games remain entertaining. However, I still dislike how the VIP guests are portrayed—their acting feels unnatural.
- The tag game stood out - the LGBT player died, and a girl gave birth during the game. A mother and baby were almost killed, but the attacker died instead. That moral conflict was interesting.
- In the jump rope game, one player used a smart tactic to push others off. Meanwhile, Tong’s mother died because her injured leg made her unable to jump.
- The final game was about voting people out over three rounds. The setup was suspenseful, but the game itself was boring. The main character sacrificed himself so the newborn baby could survive.
- The ending showed Cate Blanchett recruiting players in the USA.
