## üìà The big change near the end of the year
- Closing of Kaidee in Thailand, the product still exists but all the Thai employees will be terminated. It was Ok for me (6 months of the severance package, yay), I have been here for almost 4 years (full 4 in FEB 2023). Optimistically, it getting more and more comfortable so being forced to find a new job could be good for my career.
- Situation above accelerated me to start [warizzyutanan.com](https://www.warizzyutanan.com) and [naminana.com](https://www.naminana.com) as my portfolio.
- [neverthrow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neverthrow) is the lib of the year, not in terms of usability or technological advance but it taught me the more consistent way of handling results from a function.


## üèïÔ∏è Getting into Car Camping
- Bought [a Kodiak Canvas 8x9](https://www.google.com/search?q=kodiak+canvas+8x9) and a lot of things after it, I have to admit that it greatly improves our quality of life in camping.
- A lot more car camping because we want to make the most of the new expensive tent.
- Best camping spot: [‡πÑ‡∏£‡πà‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏°‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥](https://www.facebook.com/‡πÑ‡∏£‡πà‡∏≠‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏°‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥-930008360407443/)

## üßó Steady & polished habits
- No new habit this year but climbing, running, fasting, bujo: everything still there polished some rough edge and make them less friction.
- Climbing: hits all goals.
    - Indoor
      - [The first 7B+ in JAN](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZHZsZrlY5j/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
      - Exceed the goal by getting [the first 7C in OCT](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjWobCQpXfm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) 
    - Outdoor
      - The first 6c in APR
- Running: no significant improvement but I got more sub 1 hour for 10km runnings.
- Fasting: still mainly 1 meal a day at least 5-6 days per week.

## üéÆ üé• üé∂ Elden Ring, Horror movies, and Metal bands
- Gaming
  - Game of the year: Elden Ring, best game by far, addictive, immersive, challenging but not impossible.
  - My lovely wife bought a PS5 as a birthday gift.
  - Platinum list, Persona 5 Royal (FEB), Super Robot Wars V (MAR), Elden Ring (APR), Cyberpunk 2077 (OCT), Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales (NOV), Bloodborne (NOV), Tactics Ogre: Reborn (DEC)
  - Got into Street Fighter V for a few months, and got "Ultra Silver" as the highest rank. I planned to get back to it when the SFVI came out.
- Movie
  - Movie of the year: ‡∏£‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏á ([The Medium](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13446168/)), this year was harder to find a stand-out one, but this movie is not perfect but it shocked me in many unexpected ways and some scenes are still in the memory of me and my wife even after we watched it since FEB.
    - worth mentioning
      - [Ozark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5071412/) the last season, could be the top movie of this year but the last EP is a bit disappointing.
      - [Hawkeye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10160804/), everything is great, could be the top but it couldn't beat the remaining of "The Medium".
  - I love watching a movie that I don't know where it's going which is mostly in the horror or thriller genre.
- Music
  - Metal bands dominate my Spotify.
  - Anatomy Rabbit is my favorite pop band.
  - The most disappointing album is Car, Arctic Monkeys. I haven't read any articles about the album yet and I'm sure that if I do I will like it more but for now, it disappointed me.
  - Noteworthies: Polyphia, Animals As Leaders, Thornhill, Leisure, PREP, Limp Bizkit, Zweed'n Roll, The Black Keys.

## üé® New tattoos
- Got 2 new tattoos, one at [the back of the right hand](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf9C-teJAh_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and another one at [the inner of the right wrist](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChH-sRWpvdx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).


## ü§ü The more we fight the more we understand each other.
- Got a lot of fights with my wife but mostly not ended with finding whose false instead we're trying to find the solution for the problem.
- Nami got COVID (MAR)
- Nami and her tumor (SEP - DEC)
- Trips
  - Krabi (Railay, Northwall)
  - Lots of camping
  - Chiang Mai
  - ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏µ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà (‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏≠‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏°‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏¢‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏Å)
  - ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏¢
- Whan's wedding
- Big leap: on Valentine's day, I bought my wife a rose and hand-held it from my office to home using public transport.

## üôÇ Happiness
- No suffering = happiness, suffering = Not having a choice.
- Spark of joy moments: watching a good movie with my wife, fast breaking, sent a climbing project.

## ‚ú® Principle
- Consistency, a small step at a time.
