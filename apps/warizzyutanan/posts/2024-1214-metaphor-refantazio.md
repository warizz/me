I tried the demo on Oct 3 and pre-ordered the game. The anime cutscenes are poorly done, but the UI is great.

The gameplay loop is enjoyable, especially grinding levels, which became the highlight for me. 

However, the story didn't hold my interestâ€”I skipped most cutscenes because they were boring. The trial bosses were tedious, with too many conditions, and not fun to fight. By Nov 12, I lowered the difficulty to "Storyteller" due to fatigue but eventually reached the final dungeon.

I started New Game+ on Dec 7. With the best weapons, the second playthrough was much easier. I finished the game on Dec 14, but the final trophy, "Blade Surfer," felt pointless. Killing the red dragon at level 90 was a solid challenge to end the game. 

Overall, the grind and gameplay kept me hooked, but the story was a letdown.
