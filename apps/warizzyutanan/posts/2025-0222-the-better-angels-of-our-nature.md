## My Thoughts
The Better Angels of Our Nature is a challenging but rewarding read. While the complex vocabulary can be tough, the insights are powerful. I found the explanations of past violence, cycles of retaliation, and wars of attrition particularly eye-opening.  
I also enjoyed the discussion on how rising IQ levels contribute to empathy and self-control, reducing violence over time. The concept of nuclear deterrence was especially fascinating—how fear of mutual destruction has ironically helped maintain global peace.
