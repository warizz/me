## My Thoughts
I watch this franchise because I enjoy the creativity of each death—it’s crazy fun. This one was just as entertaining. The plot worked well, and even Nam praised how inventive it was. I liked the cheeky misdirections, with several moments teasing a death that didn’t happen right away.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- 1969: Iris Campbell prevents a tower collapse with her vision, disrupting Death’s plan.
- Present: granddaughter Stefani has nightmares, and Death begins targeting the bloodline.
- Iris sacrifices herself to prove Death is real.
- Family members die in gruesome accidents: lawnmower, trash compactor, MRI machine.
- Erik isn’t truly family but still dies horribly in an MRI sequence.
- A plan to cheat Death with Bobby’s allergy fails—both brothers die.
- Stefani is revived but never truly escaped; a train–log crash kills her and Charlie.
- Ends with no survivors; sequel teased.
