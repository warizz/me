WARNING! Contain full spoilers

The story revolves around a love triangle over a durian orchard, where the central character (Sek) has already died. The film highlights the injustice of same-sex couples being unable to marry. Toward the end, it’s revealed that Moh was also one of Sek’s lovers, offering another perspective not initially told in the story.  

The cinematography, sets, and props were beautiful. Jeff Satur (the lead) acted well and had strong screen presence. Ingfah also delivered a great performance. The entire cast was well chosen. The mother character was especially convincing—she felt so real and frustratingly slap-worthy.
