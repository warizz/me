![Mike and Amanda from Ep1](/posts/2025-0415-black-mirror-7.webp)

## My Thoughts
- Ep1 – Excellent and heart-wrenching. The idea of life as a subscription is cruel and powerful. I felt deeply for the husband. Best concept of the season.  
- Ep2 – Fun and unpredictable. The bullying and revenge theme was handled well. The tech twist at the end was over-the-top but acceptable. Feels like it could continue—I want to see where it goes next.  
- Ep3 – Focuses on AI and acting. Story was too slow and unexciting. I got bored.  
- Ep4 – Didn’t connect with this one. The concept didn’t hit for me.  
- Ep5 – Soft and emotional. Nami said it lacked tech, but I thought it was beautiful and gentle.  
- Ep6 – A long (1.5 hr) sequel. The story was okay, but it dragged too much and ended up feeling dull.
