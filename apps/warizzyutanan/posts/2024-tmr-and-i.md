A collection of four short stories set in the future:

## 1. Cloning and Identity

    A husband discovers before cloning that his wife wants to become a man. He decides to clone her as male, showcasing love and

    acceptance of her true self. Surprisingly fresh despite initial doubts about the premise.

## 2. Sex Robot Therapy

    A bold and visually striking story critiquing Thailand's

    hypocrisy, blending provocative imagery with a sharp social commentary.

## 3. Religion and Technology

    Explores faith, technology, and karmic merit. The twist involves

    cloning the abbot’s mind, revealing his suppressed desires from decades ago—a thought-provoking and fresh concept.

## 4. The Weakest Entry

    Great production quality but lacks substance. Attempts at humor fall flat, and the drama fails to engage.

Impressively, the CGI is well-done and never feels cheap or comical.
