## My thoughts
It was ok. The plot wasn’t very new, but some death scenes were brutal in a satisfying way. Still, a few situations felt less clever than expected, even though the characters seemed smart at first and almost made it through.

## Summary (Full Spoilers)
- Clover and friends visit Glore Valley searching for her missing sister, Melanie.
- They are killed by a masked killer but awaken again — trapped in a repeating night.
- They discover the loop.
- Dr. Hill is revealed as the mastermind, experimenting on victims and fueling the nightmare.
- Clover kills Hill by tricking him into drinking contaminated water, which makes him explode.
- Survivors escape as dawn breaks, but the final scene hints the cycle may continue in a snowy cabin.
