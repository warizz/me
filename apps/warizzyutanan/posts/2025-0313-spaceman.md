## My Thoughts
The movie felt slow at times, but the mystery of the cosmic secret kept me engaged until the end, even though it didn’t reveal much. The work-life balance message was interesting, but I wasn’t really invested in it. I liked the film’s meditative tone and visual style.  

## Summary (Full Spoiler)
Jakub Procházka, a Czech astronaut, is sent on a solo mission to study a mysterious cloud near Jupiter. As he struggles with loneliness and his deteriorating marriage with his pregnant wife, Lenka, he encounters Hanuš, a telepathic spider-like alien. Hanuš explores Jakub’s memories, revealing his troubled past, including his father’s controversial political history and his emotional distance from Lenka, especially during her miscarriage.  
Hanuš, who is also dying, offers Jakub insight into the cosmic cloud, where all moments in time exist simultaneously. However, instead of a grand revelation, the film focuses on Jakub’s personal growth. Realizing he wants to mend his relationship with Lenka, Jakub is rescued and returns to Earth, where they reconcile.
