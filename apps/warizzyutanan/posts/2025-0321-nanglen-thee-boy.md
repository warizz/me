Went to a concert at a theater in Siam Square One. The lighting, visuals, stage design, and overall production were beautifully done.

My wife came mainly to see Boy, who opened the show. I didn’t feel much—he seemed awkward on stage and admitted he hasn’t performed often. He said he didn’t want to repeat songs or stories, which almost caused Nami to miss *อุ๊ยปาตาบอด*, but he played it eventually.

I was surprised to learn that NangLen has many original songs. I had thought they were only a cover band. Their music is cheerful and simply written—not as stylish as Boy’s or Thee’s—but well crafted and beautiful.

Thee performed last and played many new songs. His performance was excellent, though it went on too long. Sadly, he didn’t play *สาป*, which is my favorite.

We quietly left after Thee’s set. The concert started at 4 PM and still wasn’t done by 8 PM. We couldn’t sit any longer—my butt hurt.
