![Four main characters standing together with Mount Fuji in the background.](/posts/2025-0404-the-hot-spot.webp)

## My Thoughts
- I watched it because Ter Nawapol posted about it — it caught my interest.
- The dialogue is the best part — simple, silly, but honest and funny.
- The chemistry between the four main characters is great and makes the story fun.
- I love how ordinary the show feels — nothing too dramatic, just very chill and comforting  
- Nami and I watched it together every week — it became a small weekly joy.  
- Episode 3 was really funny — that’s when I started to get the humor.  
- Episode 8 had everything — fun, cute, touching, and cheeky.  
- I didn’t like the last two episodes as much — they focused more on the mission than the character chemistry.
- If I visit Japan again, I’d love to visit some of the filming spots from the show.

## Summary (Full spoilers)
- Kiyomi Endo is a single mom working at Lake Hotel near Mt. Fuji. 
- Her life changes when she finds out her quiet coworker, Takahashi, is an alien with special powers.
- At first, she asks him to help with small things, like finding stolen hotel items or dealing with annoying coworkers.
- Later, they discover that the hotel owner and the mayor are secretly planning to sell the hotel for their own profit.
- Kiyomi teams up with Takahashi and some friends to stop them.
- In the final twist, Kiyomi finds out that her ex-husband's father is also an alien. This means her daughter, Wakaba, is part alien too.
