WARNING! Contain spoilers

Season 2 starts strong with the hunt for the recruiter and a tense confrontation between the protagonist and Gong Yoo's character. The episodes build on engaging conflicts and charming characters. The season ends with the protagonist leading others to their deaths to take over the control room, losing his friend in the process. Surprisingly, I found Season 2 better than the first.
