## My Thoughts  
The movie looks good and the acting is solid. But Arak Amornsupasiri’s character doesn’t feel convincing—he doesn’t seem like a true prison boss. The story is simple. The ending is dark, with no hope—just pain and sadness.

## Summary (Full Spoiler)
Puak, a teenager who ends up in juvenile prison after committing a crime.
Inside the prison, there are two rival teams. One team is led by Gus and Rang, known for being more fair and kind. The other is led by Beer, where Fluke also belongs, and is known for being violent and cruel. Puak is lucky to be moved to Gus’s team.

Later in the story, Fluke sacrifices himself to save Puak by eating rice porridge mixed with crushed razor blades meant to kill him. he dies from the injuries. After that, a big fight breaks out between the two teams. Gus is killed during the chaos.

In the final scene, Puak fights Beer one-on-one. Puak wins and Beer dies. After the fight, Puak is transferred to a different prison that looks even worse—more violent, with stricter and more brutal guards. The movie ends with no hope, only despair.
