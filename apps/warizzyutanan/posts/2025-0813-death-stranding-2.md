## My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- Game of the year for me, sorry Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. 
- I didn’t skip any story this time, unlike the first game where I skipped a lot near the end. A bit disappointed that the ending didn’t let us control Lou. 
- I mostly used roads (90 %) instead of zip lines like last time. The rail line was nice but too slow to use often. 
- The visuals are stunning—the most beautiful I’ve ever seen in a game. Loved the night scenes with city vibes—made me wish Kojima would make a cyberpunk game. 
- Combat was fun, both stealth and brute force. 
- I liked Doll Man even though many found him annoying—he wasn’t that talkative. 
- The game’s quirky weirdness kept me entertained and always guessing.

## Story Summary (Full Spoilers)
### Setting & Setup
* The game takes place **eleven months** after the original *Death Stranding*, spanning across **Australia**, connected via a *geo-gate* to Mexico. Humanity remains on the brink, with mechanized threats and environmental anomalies rife. 

* **Sam Porter Bridges** has retired to the U.S.–Mexico border, living peacefully with **Lou**, his adopted daughter. His quiet life is shattered when **Fragile** arrives, asking him to extend the Chiral Network into Mexico. 

### Inciting Incident & Mexico Deployment
* Sam accepts and entrusts Lou to Fragile. While Sam connects the network terminals across Mexico, Lou is tragically lost during an attack on Sam’s bunker—and Fragile is critically hurt. 

* Grieving and guilt-ridden, Sam follows Fragile to Australia via the geo-gate aboard her ship, **DHV Magellan**. Sam and the surviving crew—including **Dollman**, **Tarman**, **Heartman**, **Rainy**, and the enigmatic President of APAC—embark on rebuilding the network. 

### Revelations & Identity of "Tomorrow" (Lou)
* Higgs returns, using a phantom army of “mecha specters” to disrupt the mission. Sam is repeatedly drawn into “dark fluxes” where he battles **Neil Vana**, hauntingly tied to Lou's past. 

* Sam rescues a memory-less girl from a “coffin-chrysalis,” named **Tomorrow** by Fragile. Neil is defeated and leaves Sam with critical data from **Lucy** (Sam’s late partner), revealing that Lucy and Neil conspired to hide Lou’s identity: Lou is indeed Sam’s biological daughter. The Bridge Baby capsule has always been empty—it was all a coping illusion. 

### Climax: Betrayals & the True Enemy
* As Sam nears completion of the Australian network, the President betrays everyone—revealed to be a collective consciousness of four thousand dead souls fused into APAC’s AI. He plans to place every human’s consciousness forever in their “Beach” to eliminate extinction threats. 
* **Charlie**, secretly **Die‑Hardman**, intervenes—using Sam’s Q-Pid device to sabotage APAC’s control over the network. 
* Higgs reemerges, capturing Tomorrow and revealing her powers as a new “Extinction Entity” capable of triggering the “Last Stranding.” In the ensuing melee on the Beach, Sam ultimately defeats Higgs—with Lou, now towering in size, dealing the final blow. 

* Fragile dies—but the twist is that she had already died back during her attempt to protect Lou during the bunker assault; she existed afterward only in a between-realm state. 

* It’s revealed Lou grew rapidly on Neil's Beach under Fragile’s care. The emotional reunion between father and daughter, reunited with memory and purpose, brings closure. 

### Epilogue
* After the credits, Lou is shown as a grown porter, standing before a new geo-gate—symbolizing her own future journey, a torch-passing from Sam to the next generation.
