## My Thoughts
I found this book after reading the article [Structured Procrastination](https://www.structuredprocrastination.com/index.php), which I loved—it was funny and had a cheeky tone. The book is super short and took just a little time to finish. It’s not as hilarious as the original article, but still very relatable. The writing felt relaxed and casual, making it a light and enjoyable read. Perfect when you want something not too serious.

## Summary (Full Spoiler)
### Chapter 1 – Structured Procrastination
Perry introduces the main idea: instead of doing the most important task, procrastinators often work on slightly less important—but still useful—things. This is actually a strength, not a flaw. He calls it “structured procrastination.”

### Chapter 2 – The Procrastinator’s Personality
He explains that many procrastinators are perfectionists. They avoid tasks because they fear they won’t do them well. This fear can lead to a lot of avoidance and pressure.

### Chapter 3 – Lists and Self-Deception
One trick is to make a to-do list with fake top-priority tasks. By trying to avoid those, you’ll end up doing real, productive things. Self-deception, when used well, can be a useful tool.

### Chapter 4 – Procrastination at Work
Perry shares how procrastination often leads people to do smaller tasks—like replying to emails or cleaning the desk—instead of big projects. This still counts as being productive in its own way.

### Chapter 5 – Procrastination and Guilt
Many procrastinators feel guilty all the time. Perry encourages letting go of that guilt. If you’re doing something useful, even if it’s not what you’re “supposed” to do, it still matters.

### Chapter 6 – Living with It
Instead of trying to fix procrastination, Perry suggests accepting it and making it work for you. Life’s too short to always chase the “most important” task first.
