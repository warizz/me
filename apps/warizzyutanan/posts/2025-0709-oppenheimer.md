### My thoughts (Spoilers)
- The movie is dialogue-heavy but never boring, even at 3 hours.
- Einstein has a mysterious, wise presence.
- Almost every role is played by a familiar face—huge cast.
- Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) stands out as Lewis Strauss. He looks much older than in _Iron Man_, likely due to makeup.
- Strauss’s deep grudge against Oppenheimer becomes a major plotline, which is both strange and interesting.
- The final stretch of the bomb-building segment is especially exciting.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- J. Robert Oppenheimer studies physics in Europe and returns to teach in the U.S.
- He becomes involved with leftist and communist groups through Jean Tatlock and later Kitty, whom he marries.
- During WWII, General Leslie Groves selects Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project.
- Oppenheimer gathers top scientists at Los Alamos to build the atomic bomb.
- After much effort, the Trinity test succeeds.
- The bombs are dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the war.
- Oppenheimer is haunted by the bomb’s destruction and begins to speak against further nuclear weapons development.
- He opposes the hydrogen bomb and loses favor with the U.S. government.
- Lewis Strauss, a former ally and now political figure, feels personally slighted by Oppenheimer.
- Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing to destroy Oppenheimer’s reputation.
- The hearing is one-sided, and Oppenheimer loses his security clearance, effectively ending his influence.
- The film ends with a flashback to a conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein, implying their work may have started a global chain reaction.
