## My Thoughts
- Episode 1 – The arrest and interrogation scenes were gripping and full of tension.  
- Episode 2 – The investigation at school made me feel the fear and disconnect between generations.  
- Episode 3 – The conversations between the psychologist and Jamie were powerful. I was amazed by the acting.  
- Episode 4 – It made me feel sympathy for the family of the accused. It showed how deep the pain runs even for those around him.
