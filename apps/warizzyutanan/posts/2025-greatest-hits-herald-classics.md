(disheartened) I bought _Greatest Hits (Herald Classics)_ thinking it would be a good read, but it turned out to be challenging and confusing. Many stories were hard to understand due to their abstract or metaphorical writing style.

(confused) Early stories like _I Have No Mouth, But I Must Scream_ were unsettling but somewhat engaging. Others, like _Chatting with Anubis_, felt easier to read but left me puzzled. Some, like _On the Downhill Side_, made no sense at all.

(amused) A few stories stood out as enjoyable: _Jeffty is Five_ was easy to follow yet sad, _Shatterday_ had an intriguing twist, and _Mefisto in Onyx_ was cleverly plotted with multiple twists.

(entertained) The later stories had a mix of emotions: _Paladin_ was touching, _Iâ€™m Looking for Kadak_ was funny and lighthearted, and _Genie_ was comical with its multidimensional shop and grumpy genie.

(fatigued) The final story was long and hard to follow, though it had an interesting idea about writing with brutal honesty, which made me reflect on storytelling.

Overall: (overwhelmed) _Greatest Hits (Herald Classics)_ was a challenging read with a mix of intriguing, confusing, and entertaining stories. It made me realize how hard classic literature and short stories can be to understand. I gave it 2/5 stars.
