### My Thoughts  
Creepy atmosphere, minimal jump scares (which is good), brutal ending. The father and son are pitiful, completely unaware of what they’re dealing with. But the revenge aspect makes sense. 
### Summary (Full Spoiler)  
The movie follows a father and son, both coroners, who receive the body of an unidentified woman (Jane Doe) for an autopsy. As they examine her, they discover eerie anomalies—her body has no external wounds, yet her internal organs show signs of severe trauma.  
As they continue, strange occurrences escalate: lights flicker, strange noises fill the morgue, and supernatural events begin to unfold. It becomes clear that Jane Doe is no ordinary corpse—she harbors a dark force seeking revenge.  
The father and son try to escape but are trapped inside the morgue. The father eventually realizes Jane Doe was a victim of horrific torture, possibly a witch from centuries past, and her suffering has turned into an unstoppable curse. Desperate to end the nightmare, he offers himself as a sacrifice, but it’s in vain—his son is left alone, only to meet the same tragic fate.  
In the final scene, Jane Doe’s body remains untouched, flawless as before, ready to be transported to another location, suggesting the cycle of terror will continue.
