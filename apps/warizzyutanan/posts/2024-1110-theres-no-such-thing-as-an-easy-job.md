WARNING! Contain spoilers

The protagonist, burned out from her previous job, starts a series of seemingly simple jobs near her home. Each role reveals small, human details that make the story relatable and enjoyable (I like these little details—they feel very human).

The jobs range from surveillance work to writing bus ads and even sticking up posters while investigating a secretive group. Each job brings unique experiences, like small victories, frustrations, and moments of reflection. Her final job, watching over a park, leads to a surprising investigation into a missing person. She eventually quits due to allergies and decides to commit to a stable career.

The protagonist appears to dislike work and seeks easy jobs, but in reality, she’s deeply committed, which likely caused her burnout initially.

Overall, the book isn’t thrilling but is an enjoyable read. The ordinary characters and charming details make it delightful (I like how it shows normal lives with relatable struggles and cute moments).
