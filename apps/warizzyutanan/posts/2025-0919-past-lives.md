## My thoughts
It had been a long time since we watched a romantic drama. The film was beautifully shot, calm, and simple. Toward the end, I felt uncomfortable for the husband, while Haesong’s performance stood out—his awkwardness, especially in English, felt very natural. The ending left me feeling pity for everyone involved. It was quiet but deep, not overly dramatic, and overall a good watch.

## Summary (full spoilers)
1. Na-Young and Hae Sung, age 12, share a close bond. Na-Young emigrates with her family to Canada, changes name to Nora, and loses contact.
2. Nora in New York, Hae Sung in Korea reconnect online. They talk often via video calls, but life commitments (his Mandarin program, her writers’ retreat) pull them apart. Nora chooses to pause their contact.
3. Nora meets Arthur at the retreat; they fall in love. They discuss *inyeon* (fate, connections across lives).
4. Nora is married to Arthur. Hae Sung, now single, visits New York. Arthur quietly worries about their cultural and emotional gap.
5. The three go to a bar. Nora translates between Arthur and Hae Sung, then shares a deep conversation in Korean with Hae Sung about what could have been. Outside, Hae Sung says perhaps this is just another past life and asks about their next one. Nora says she doesn’t know. He leaves.
6. Nora returns to Arthur, crying. He comforts her. The film ends with an acceptance of the lives they now have and the unchosen paths that will forever linger as “what ifs.”
