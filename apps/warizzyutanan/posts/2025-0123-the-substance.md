## Plot

An aging actress, unwilling to accept getting old, discovers a drug that allows her to split into two bodies. The movie ignores logic entirely—the drug works instantly, the process requires no instructions, and everything just happens. In the second half, the younger body refuses to switch back, creating a conflict as it tries to cheat time, affecting the older body. The story escalates to an extreme climax where the protagonist transforms into a grotesque creature.

## Thoughts

The visuals are stunning, like a commercial or music video, but the realism and logic are weak, leaving me with constant questions. The second half is thrilling and engaging, especially during the conflict between the two bodies. The ending is absurdly entertaining with impressive effects.

While the 2-hour runtime felt too long (1.5 hours would’ve been better), I’m glad I finished it. Initially, I thought the director was inexperienced, focusing more on visuals than substance. However, learning about the awards and nominations afterward made me see the film in a different light.
