### My Thoughts
The first two episodes were a bit slow, but from episode three onwards, the series became very engaging. I ended up watching episodes 3 to 7 in one go.

The underdog storyline is compelling and well-executed, making the show entertaining and thrilling. After finishing it, I felt compelled to share my thoughts on Instagram Stories.

The production quality is excellent, and the actors deliver strong performances. Each character has a unique and interesting personality, keeping the narrative fresh and engaging.

### Plot Summary (Full Spoiler)
*Mad Unicorn* is a Thai drama series inspired by the real-life story of Komsan Lee, founder of Flash Express, Thailand's first unicorn startup. 

The story follows Santi Saelee, a determined young man from a poor background in northern Thailand. Fluent in Mandarin thanks to his mother, Santi starts working in a sand mine and later moves to Bangkok to pursue better opportunities.

In Bangkok, Santi works various jobs, including as a tour guide and translator for Chinese tourists. He pitches a business idea to Kanin, a powerful tycoon, but is betrayed when Kanin attempts to steal the idea for himself. 

Determined to succeed, Santi teams up with Xiaoyu, a savvy financier, and Ruijie, a talented coder, to launch his own express delivery company, Thunder Express. 

As Thunder Express grows rapidly, Santi faces numerous challenges, including aggressive tactics from Kanin, who seeks to undermine his success. Despite these obstacles, Santi's resilience and innovative strategies help Thunder Express become Thailand's first unicorn startup.
