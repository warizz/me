## My Thoughts  
Zenless Zone Zero is incredibly addictive, with stylish characters and a satisfying combat system. Despite starting with a goal of not spending money, I eventually bought a growth plan to support the game because I enjoyed it so much. The gacha system is both exciting and risky, but I appreciate the guaranteed pulls. I also like the daily tasks and saving up for future character pulls, especially for Miyabi.  

## My timeline
- Feb 10: Started the game and got hooked. Loved the combat systemâ€”simple, stylish, and satisfying. First time playing a gacha game, planning to aim only for the platinum trophy without spending money. Later learned that characters are obtained through gacha, with a pity system guaranteeing A- and S-rank characters.  
- Feb 15: Fully addicted, playing non-stop.  
- Feb 17: Used about 90 master tapes in the morning, pulling one S-rank (Soldier 11) and a few A-rank characters.  
- Mar 7: Bought the growth plan for 349 THB, justifying it as supporting the game since I enjoyed it so much.  
- Mar 10: Achieved the platinum trophy.
