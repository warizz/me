## My Thoughts (Spoilers)
- The opening was strong, showing the sad life of lawyer Björn Diemel, who was easy to sympathize with. 
- But later the excitement dropped because he became too skilled, and many events felt unrealistic. 
- I don’t think I’d watch season 2 if it comes out.

### Plot Summary (Spoilers)
- Björn Diemel was a defense lawyer for mob boss Dragan, but his marriage was falling apart. His wife sent him to mindfulness therapy to learn balance.
- While taking his daughter Emily to a lakeside house, Björn locked Dragan in his car trunk and forgot about him. Dragan died, and instead of panicking, Björn covered it up. He used Dragan’s death to gain control of the mob, hiding the truth by manipulating Dragan’s men.
- He framed rivals like Toni and handed him over to Borris, another gangster. Later he killed Borris by locking him in a trunk as well. Step by step, Björn became the new mob leader, always staying calm thanks to his mindfulness training.
- Detective Nicole suspected him but was emotionally manipulated into backing off. However, in the end, Emily accidentally activated a toy that contained Björn’s recorded confession about killing Dragan. Nicole realized the truth, hinting that Björn’s crimes might not stay hidden forever.
- The season ended with Björn in power but under quiet threat, setting up for a second season.
